# caesar-cipher-program
It's written in python programming language.

This program can encode or decode user's text. User can choose the direction of the program, either encode or decode.
To encode, it will right shift each letter to the shift amount given by user. To decode, it will left shift each letter to the shift amount given by user.  

For example:

If you want to encrypt your text:\
direction = "encode"\
text = "I love you <3"\
shift = 12\
encrypted_text = "u xahq kag <3"\


If you want to decrypt your text:\
direction = "decode"\
text = "u xahq kag <3"\
shift = 12\
encrypted_text = "I love you <3"\
